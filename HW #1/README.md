In this project,
we were asked to implement a Feed-Forward Neural Network and the backpropagation process with only NumPy Library.
We were not allowed to use any of Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, or any related frameworks.

It was a classification task and we used:

ReLU as activation function

Softmax in the last layer to calculate probability of each label

Cross Entropy as loss function for the Backpropagation process
