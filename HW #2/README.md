In this part, I implemented two articles using the structure of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and pytorch tools.
As you know, CNNs are widely used in video and image processing today and are also used for processing text. 
This exercise gave us the opportunity to better understand CNNs and their features by implementing these networks and facing their challenges.


In the first question, I implemented the Deep Convnet model from this article. The goal was to predict saliency maps for input images.


In the second question, I implemented this article. The purpose of this question was to train decoder models for the AlexNet network in such a way to construct input images based on the output of four layers in AlexNet (Which have extracted different features).
